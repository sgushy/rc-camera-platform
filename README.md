# rc-camera-platform

<p>This is a wirelessly controlled camera platform suitable for a smartphone, involving mechanical, electrical, and firmware elements, designed and built by a group of 2 for the Mechatronics Design class at UC Berkeley. The firmware was written in C++ using the Arduino platform, and the device was made using 2 ESP-32 microcontrollers, some RC car transmission gears, skateboard bearings, metal rods, a handful of $1 MPU-6050 and MPU-9250 IMU boards, and some 3d printed plastic parts.</p>

<p>Below are a few images of the (from left to right) assembled camera platform, tilt sensing remote control (with camera platform internals visible in background), and remote control internals.</p>
